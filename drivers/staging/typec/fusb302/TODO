fusb302:
- Find a better logging scheme, at least not having the same debugging/logging
  code replicated here and in tcpm
- Find a non-hacky way to coordinate between PM and I2C access
- Documentation? The FUSB302 datasheet provides information on the chip to help
  understand the code. But it may still be helpful to have a documentation.
