tcpm:
- Add documentation (at the very least for the API to low level drivers)
- Split PD code into separate file
- Check if it makes sense to use tracepoints instead of debugfs for debug logs
- Implement Alternate Mode handling
- Address "#if 0" code if not addressed with the above
- Validate all comments marked with "XXX"; either address or remove comments
- Add support for USB PD 3.0. While not mandatory, at least fast role swap
  as well as authentication support would be very desirable.

tcpci:
- Test with real hardware
