Arm TrustZone CryptoCell cryptographic accelerators

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "arm,cryptocell-712-ree".
- reg: shall contain base register location and length.
	Typically length is 0x10000.
- interrupts: shall contain the interrupt for the device.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: can designate the interrupt controller the
	device interrupt is connected to, if needed.
- clocks: may contain the clock handling the device, if needed.
- power-domains: may contain a reference to the PM domain, if applicable.


Examples:

Zynq FPGA device
----------------

       arm_cc7x: arm_cc7x@80000000 {
               compatible = "arm,cryptocell-712-ree";
               interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
               interrupts = < 0 30 4 >;
               reg = < 0x80000000 0x10000 >;
       };
