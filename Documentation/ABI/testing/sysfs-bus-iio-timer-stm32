What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/triggerX/master_mode_available
KernelVersion:	4.11
Contact:	benjamin.gaignard@st.com
Description:
		Reading returns the list possible master modes which are:
		- "reset"     :	The UG bit from the TIMx_EGR register is
				used as trigger output (TRGO).
		- "enable"    : The Counter Enable signal CNT_EN is used
				as trigger output.
		- "update"    : The update event is selected as trigger output.
				For instance a master timer can then be used
				as a prescaler for a slave timer.
		- "compare_pulse" : The trigger output send a positive pulse
				    when the CC1IF flag is to be set.
		- "OC1REF"    : OC1REF signal is used as trigger output.
		- "OC2REF"    : OC2REF signal is used as trigger output.
		- "OC3REF"    : OC3REF signal is used as trigger output.
		- "OC4REF"    : OC4REF signal is used as trigger output.

KernelVersion:	4.12
Contact:	benjamin.gaignard@st.com
Description:
		Reading returns the current preset value.
		Writing sets the preset value.
		When counting up the counter starts from 0 and fires an
		event when reach preset value.
		When counting down the counter start from preset value
		and fire event when reach 0.

Description:
		Reading returns the list possible quadrature modes.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/in_count0_quadrature_mode
KernelVersion:	4.12
Contact:	benjamin.gaignard@st.com
Description:
		Configure the device counter quadrature modes:
		channel_A:
			Encoder A input servers as the count input and B as
			the UP/DOWN direction control input.

		channel_B:
			Encoder B input serves as the count input and A as
			the UP/DOWN direction control input.

		quadrature:
			Encoder A and B inputs are mixed to get direction
			and count with a scale of 0.25.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/in_count_enable_mode_available

Description:
		Reading returns the list possible enable modes.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/in_count0_enable_mode
KernelVersion:	4.12
Contact:	benjamin.gaignard@st.com
Description:
		Configure the device counter enable modes, in all case
		counting direction is set by in_count0_count_direction
		attribute and the counter is clocked by the internal clock.
		always:
			Counter is always ON.

		gated:
			Counting is enabled when connected trigger signal
			level is high else counting is disabled.

		triggered:
			Counting is enabled on rising edge of the connected
			trigger, and remains enabled for the duration of this
			selected mode.
