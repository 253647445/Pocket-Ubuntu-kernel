Allwinner Clock Control Unit Binding
------------------------------------

Required properties :
- compatible: must contain one of the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun6i-a31-ccu"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-a23-ccu"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-a33-ccu"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ccu"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-r-ccu"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-v3s-ccu"
		- "allwinner,sun9i-a80-ccu"
		- "allwinner,sun50i-a64-ccu"
		- "allwinner,sun50i-a64-r-ccu"
		- "allwinner,sun50i-h5-ccu"

- reg: Must contain the registers base address and length
- clocks: phandle to the oscillators feeding the CCU. Two are needed:
  - "hosc": the high frequency oscillator (usually at 24MHz)
  - "losc": the low frequency oscillator (usually at 32kHz)
- clock-names: Must contain the clock names described just above
- #clock-cells : must contain 1
- #reset-cells : must contain 1

For the PRCM CCUs on H3/A64, one more clock is needed:
- "iosc": the SoC's internal frequency oscillator

Example for generic CCU:
ccu: clock@01c20000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ccu";
	reg = <0x01c20000 0x400>;
	clocks = <&osc24M>, <&osc32k>;
	clock-names = "hosc", "losc";
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	#reset-cells = <1>;
};

Example for PRCM CCU:
r_ccu: clock@01f01400 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun50i-a64-r-ccu";
	reg = <0x01f01400 0x100>;
	clocks = <&osc24M>, <&osc32k>, <&iosc>;
	clock-names = "hosc", "losc", "iosc";
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	#reset-cells = <1>;
};
