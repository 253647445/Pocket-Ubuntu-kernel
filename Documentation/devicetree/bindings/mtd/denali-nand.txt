* Denali NAND controller

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be one of the following:
      "altr,socfpga-denali-nand"            - for Altera SOCFPGA
  - reg : should contain registers location and length for data and reg.
  - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "nand_data" and "denali_reg"
  - interrupts : The interrupt number.

The device tree may optionally contain sub-nodes describing partitions of the
address space. See partition.txt for more detail.

Examples:

nand: nand@ff900000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	compatible = "altr,socfpga-denali-nand";
	reg = <0xff900000 0x100000>, <0xffb80000 0x10000>;
	reg-names = "nand_data", "denali_reg";
	interrupts = <0 144 4>;
};
