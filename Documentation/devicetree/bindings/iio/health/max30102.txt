Maxim MAX30102 heart rate and pulse oximeter sensor

* https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX30102.pdf

Required properties:
  - compatible: must be "maxim,max30102"
  - reg: the I2C address of the sensor
  - interrupt-parent: should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  - interrupts: the sole interrupt generated by the device

  Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
  interrupt client node bindings.

Optional properties:
  - maxim,red-led-current-microamp: configuration for RED LED current
  - maxim,ir-led-current-microamp: configuration for IR LED current

    Note that each step is approximately 200 microamps, ranging from 0 uA to
    50800 uA.

Example:

max30100@57 {
	compatible = "maxim,max30102";
	reg = <0x57>;
	maxim,red-led-current-microamp = <7000>;
	maxim,ir-led-current-microamp = <7000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
	interrupts = <16 2>;
};
