NAME

perf-ftrace - simple wrapper for kernel's ftrace functionality


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'perf ftrace' <command>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The 'perf ftrace' command is a simple wrapper of kernel's ftrace
functionality.  It only supports single thread tracing currently and
just reads trace_pipe in text and then write it to stdout.

The following options apply to perf ftrace.

OPTIONS
-------

-t::
--tracer=::
	Tracer to use: function_graph or function.

-v::
--verbose=::
        Verbosity level.

-p::
--pid=::
	Trace on existing process id (comma separated list).

-a::
--all-cpus::
	Force system-wide collection.  Scripts run without a <command>
	normally use -a by default, while scripts run with a <command>
	normally don't - this option allows the latter to be run in
	system-wide mode.

-C::
--cpu=::
	Only trace for the list of CPUs provided.  Multiple CPUs can
	be provided as a comma separated list with no space like: 0,1.
	Ranges of CPUs are specified with -: 0-2.
	Default is to trace on all online CPUs.
