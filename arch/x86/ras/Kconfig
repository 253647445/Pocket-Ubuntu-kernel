	  This is a simple debugfs interface to inject MCEs and test different
	  aspects of the MCE handling code.

	  WARNING: Do not even assume this interface is staying stable!

config RAS_CEC
	bool "Correctable Errors Collector"
	depends on X86_MCE && MEMORY_FAILURE && DEBUG_FS
	---help---
	  This is a small cache which collects correctable memory errors per 4K
	  page PFN and counts their repeated occurrence. Once the counter for a
	  PFN overflows, we try to soft-offline that page as we take it to mean
	  that it has reached a relatively high error count and would probably
	  be best if we don't use it anymore.

	  Bear in mind that this is absolutely useless if your platform doesn't
	  have ECC DIMMs and doesn't have DRAM ECC checking enabled in the BIOS.
